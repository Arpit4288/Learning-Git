// If you want specific branch from github when you have multiple branch in one repo like signin branch, singnup branch and all
git push origin your-branch  // for pull request for other developers
git push -u origin signup  // for adding signup branch to the github on top of main not inside main
// there are 4 type of branch   feature/, bug/, hotfix/, 
git fetch origin branch  // downloades branches entry in your local without changes anything then you can simply checkout to that branch
git config  // for configuration (local set the name and email so that your github recognizes this)
// git clone and git clone are not same
// git clone  copy of all heirarchy in your local (main --> signup, signin branches)
// now you have a copy of main heirarchy and somebody comes and push some new branh onto github like (main --> signup, signin, login)
// you want to only that new branch so you can use fetch like -->
git fetch origin branch_name
